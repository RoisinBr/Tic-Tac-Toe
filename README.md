# Tic Tac Toe
[Play Game](https://roisinbr.github.io/project1/)


## Game Play

Players take turns attempting to get either three X's or three O's in a row horizonatally, vertically or diaganolly.  If neither player obtains three in a row, the game is declared a draw. X is the first player. 


## Approach

Keep it as simple as possible.  First establishing how the game works and then designing code that perfmorms this.


## Future Iterations

1. Allow player to input name.
2. Allow player to choose character/image.
